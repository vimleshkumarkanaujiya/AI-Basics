## AI-Basics
### Artificial Intelligence Prerequisites


Before diving into Artificial Intelligence (AI), it's essential to have a solid foundation in the following basics:

1. **Programming**: Proficiency in a programming language is crucial. Python is a popular choice due to its simplicity and extensive libraries for AI and data science.

2. **Mathematics**:
   - **Linear Algebra**: Understand concepts like matrices, vectors, and matrix operations, as they are fundamental in AI.
   - **Calculus**: Know about derivatives and integrals, which are used in optimization algorithms.
   - **Probability and Statistics**: These are essential for understanding and working with data.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Learn how to clean, format, and preprocess data for AI models.
   - **Data Structures**: Understand data storage structures, such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries.

4. **Machine Learning Fundamentals**:
   - **Supervised Learning**: Learn about classification and regression algorithms.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Explore clustering and dimensionality reduction.
   - **Validation and Cross-Validation**: Understand techniques for model evaluation.

5. **Databases**: Familiarize yourself with databases and SQL, as data retrieval and storage are critical in AI.

6. **Version Control**: Learn to use tools like Git to track changes in your AI projects.

7. **Linear Regression and Optimization Techniques**: Understand linear regression and how optimization algorithms work, as these are building blocks for more advanced models.

8. **Probability Distributions**: Gain a good grasp of probability distributions, especially Gaussian (normal) distributions, which are commonly used in AI.

9. **Software Development**: Learn the basics of software development, as AI projects often involve writing and maintaining code.

10. **Tools and Libraries**: Familiarize yourself with AI libraries and tools like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

11. **Basic Data Visualization**: Learn to use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data and model results.

12. **Domain Knowledge**: Depending on your AI application area (e.g., healthcare, finance, robotics), acquire domain-specific knowledge.

13. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**: Understand ethical and legal issues in AI, such as privacy, bias, and responsible AI development.

14. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically and analytically.

15. **Online Courses and Tutorials**: Enroll in online courses or tutorials that cover AI fundamentals, such as Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

These foundational skills and knowledge will provide you with a solid basis for understanding and working with AI concepts, algorithms, and models. As you progress, you can explore specialized areas within AI, such as computer vision, natural language processing, or reinforcement learning.
